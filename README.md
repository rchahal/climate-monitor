# climate-monitor
This is a sample project using SpringBoot and ThymeLeaf.

This project loads data from a CSV file into an in memory database.  When first starting the project, go to this URL first to trigger the loading of the CSV data.
.../climateInfo/loadAllData

From there, the project is pretty self explanatory.  The requirements for this project are below.

All my time this week was already allocated - so finding a bit of time for this was a nightmare.
There's a lot I'd like to do differently, and lots of little things left undone.  My main focus was to get something working quickly.
